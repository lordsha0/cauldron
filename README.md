# Cauldron

A basic ruby RSS feed that you can read in your terminal!

You can make it into a command by making a file
```
echo "ruby /home/${USER}/cauldron/main.rb" >> cauldron
```
And moving the file to your bin folder
```
sudo mv ~/cauldron /usr/bin/
```
Without forgeting to make it an executable:
```
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/cauldron
```

and you'll be able to run cauldron as a nice RSS feed with a simple `cauldron` command in your terminal!



**To change the urls just modify the urls.txt file in the directory**
